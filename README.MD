This PowerShell module is taken from https://github.com/whistler-consulting/LenovoInfo which seems abandonded. And mostly worked.  Should the PR ever get merged, we can use that one.


Original README.MD:
This Powershell module uses a REST API provided by Lenovo to lookup warranty information for various Lenovo devices.
